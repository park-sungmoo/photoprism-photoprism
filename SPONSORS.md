Let's join forces
=================

You're most welcome to support us via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/lastzero), 
especially if you need help with using our software. They will match every donation in the first year.
In addition, you can find us on [Patreon][patreon] and [PayPal][paypal].
Our sponsors and contributors will get for free whatever we might have to 
[charge](https://docs.photoprism.org/en/latest/funding/) for a geodata, public events and maps 
subscription later.

Also please [leave a star](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/stargazers) here on GitHub if you like this project, 
it provides additional motivation to keep going.

Ideas backed by a sponsor are marked with a golden [sponsor][issues:sponsor] label.
Let us know if we mistakenly label an idea as [unfunded][issues:unfunded].

Thank you very much to all of our sponsors and donors (including those that want to stay private)!
