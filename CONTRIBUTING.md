# Every contribution makes a difference

Think of open-source development as free training with a visible outcome.
Exploring new technologies is easier than in commercial environments,
where development effort is more focused on immediate results.
Consider it as an analytical process that expands both the master and the 
editors knowledge, including others viewing it.

We welcome contributions of any kind including pull requests, ideas, bug reports,
testing, writing documentation, tutorials and blog posts. If you help with development,
you have the opportunity to learn Docker, Go, TensorFlow and much more.

## Questions? ##

Follow us on [Twitter][twitter] and join our [developers mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/photoprism.org/forum/#!forum/developers)
to receive regular project updates, get in contact with other contributors and discuss your ideas. Don't be afraid to ask stupid questions.

Of all the tools we tested, Twitter works best to get and give continuous feedback. Especially polls are amazing for product development.
