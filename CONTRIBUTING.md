## Creating Bug Reports ##

Before reporting a bug, please use our [Troubleshooting Checklists](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/)
to determine the cause of your problem. If you have a general question, need help, or an issue has not
(yet) been clearly identified:

- you are welcome to ask in our [Community Chat](https://gitter.im/browseyourlife/community)
- and post your question in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/discussions)

### GitHub Issues ###

Don't report a bug unless you are sure you found a new problem that must be fixed directly in the app:

- Ask for [technical support](https://photoprism.app/contact) if you need help, it could be a local configuration issue, or a misunderstanding in how the software works
- This gives our team the opportunity to [improve the documentation](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/) and provide best-in-class support to you, instead of spending time handling incomplete and/or duplicate bug reports
- When reporting a problem, always include the software versions you are using and other information about your environment such as [browser, browser plugins](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/browsers/), operating system, storage type, memory size, and processor
