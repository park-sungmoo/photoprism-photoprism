PhotoPrism is a server-based application for browsing, organizing and sharing your personal photo collection.
It makes use of the latest technologies to automatically tag and find pictures without getting in your way.
Say goodbye to solutions that force you to upload your visual memories to the cloud or pay monthly fees.

## Why this has to be free software

The development of every commercial product is focused on monetization.
We've built similar apps more than once and every single time the constraints of working
in a profit-oriented corporate environment were an impediment.
We are sure we can do better with only a fraction of the budget. Simplicity can be very powerful.
Go, the programming language we're using, is a great example. It is heavily influenced by the ideas of Niklaus Wirth.

> Simple, elegant solutions are more effective, but they are harder to find than complex ones, and they require more time, which we too often believe to be unaffordable.
> â€” NIKLAUS WIRTH, CACM, FEB. 1985
