PhotoPrism¬Æ is an AI-powered app for browsing, organizing & sharing your photo collection.
It makes use of the latest technologies to tag and find pictures automatically without getting in your way.
You can run it at home, on a private server, or in the cloud.

To get a first impression, you are welcome to play with our [public demo](https://try.photoprism.app/). Be careful not to upload any private pictures.

* Easily find specific pictures using [powerful search filters](https://try.photoprism.app/browse?view=cards&q=flower%20color%3Ared)

## Getting Started ##
<img align="right" width="25%" src="https://photoprism.app/user/pages/01.home/03._screenshots/iphone-maps-hybrid-540px.png">

Step-by-step installation instructions for our self-hosted [community edition](https://photoprism.app/get) can be found 
on [docs.photoprism.app](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/) -
all you need is a Web browser and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to run the server. 
It is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

The [stable version](https://docs.photoprism.app/release-notes/) and development 
preview have been built into a single [multi-arch image](https://link.photoprism.app/docker-hub) for 64-bit AMD, Intel,
and ARM processors. That means, [Raspberry Pi](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/raspberry-pi/) 3 / 4 owners can pull 
from the same repository, enjoy the exact same functionality, and can follow the regular 
[installation instructions](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/docker-compose/) 
after going through a short list of [requirements](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/raspberry-pi/).

Existing users are advised to update their `docker-compose.yml` config based on our examples
available at [dl.photoprism.app/docker](https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/).

## Upcoming Features and Improvements ##

**Our vision is to provide the most user- and privacy-friendly solution to keep your pictures organized and accessible.**
The [roadmap](https://link.photoprism.app/roadmap) shows what tasks are in progress, what needs testing, and which features are going to be implemented next.
Please give ideas you like a thumbs-up üëç  , so that we know what is most popular.

Ideas endorsed by [silver, gold, and platinum sponsors](https://link.photoprism.app/sponsors) receive a [golden label](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asponsor) and will be prioritized on the [roadmap](https://link.photoprism.app/roadmap).
Note that we have a zero bug policy and do our best to help users when they need support or have other questions.
This comes at a price, as we can't give exact deadlines for new features.
Our team will consider all requests, but is not obligated to implement the features, improvements, or other changes you request.

Having said that, funding really has the highest impact. So users can do their part and
[become a sponsor](https://docs.photoprism.app/funding/) to get their favorite features as soon as possible.

### GitHub Issues ###

We kindly ask you not to report bugs via GitHub Issues **unless you are certain to have found a fully reproducible and previously unreported issue** that must be fixed directly in the app. Thank you for your careful consideration!

- When reporting a problem, always include the software versions you are using and other information about your environment such as [browser, browser plugins](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/browsers/), operating system, [storage type](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#storage), [memory size](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#memory), and [processor](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#server-cpu)
- Note that all issue **subscribers receive an email notification** from GitHub for each new comment, so these should only be used for sharing important information and not for personal discussions/questions
- [Contact us](https://photoprism.app/contact) or [a community member](https://link.photoprism.app/discussions) if you need help, it could be a local configuration problem, or a misunderstanding in how the software works
- This gives our team the opportunity to [improve the docs](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/) and provide best-in-class support to you, instead of handling unclear/duplicate bug reports or triggering a flood of notifications by responding to comments
