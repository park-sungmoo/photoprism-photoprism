## Getting Started ##

Step-by-step installation instructions for our self-hosted [community edition](https://photoprism.app/get) can be found 
on [docs.photoprism.org](https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/) -
all you need is a Web browser and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to run the server. 
It is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

Our [latest release](https://docs.photoprism.org/release-notes/) not only includes 
**facial recognition**, it also comes as a 
**single [multi-arch image](https://hub.docker.com/r/photoprism/photoprism) for AMD64, ARM64, and ARMv7**. 
That means you don't need to pull from different Docker repositories anymore.
We recommend updating your existing `docker-compose.yml` config based on 
[our examples](https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/).
