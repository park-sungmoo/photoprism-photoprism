PhotoPrism¬Æ is a privately hosted app for browsing, organizing, and sharing your photo collection.
It makes use of the latest technologies to tag and find pictures automatically without getting in your way.
Say goodbye to uploading your visual memories to the cloud!

To get a first impression, you're welcome to play with our public demo at [demo.photoprism.org](https://demo.photoprism.org/).

## Key Features ##

* Our intuitive [Web UI](https://demo.photoprism.org/) makes browsing and organizing your photo collection as easy as
  it should be ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer
* Index all your photos and videos without worrying about duplicates, [RAW to JPEG conversion](https://docs.photoprism.org/user-guide/settings/library/), or video transcoding
* Includes four high-resolution [world maps](https://demo.photoprism.org/places) to see where you've been,
  and for rediscovering long-forgotten shots
* Enjoy privacy-preserving face detection and recognition üíé
* Automatic [image classification](https://docs.photoprism.org/developer-guide/metadata/classification/)
  based on Google TensorFlow ‚Äì in addition, PhotoPrism detects many other properties such as _colors_, _chroma_, _luminance_, _quality_, _panoramic projection_,
  and _location type_
* Use [PhotoSync](https://www.photosync-app.com/) to securely backup iOS and Android mobile devices in the background
* WebDAV clients, like Microsoft‚Äôs Windows Explorer or Apple's Finder, may
  [connect](https://docs.photoprism.org/user-guide/sync/webdav/) directly to PhotoPrism so that you to can open,
  edit, and delete files from your computer or phone as if they were local
* Because PhotoPrism is built as a [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps),
  it provides a native app-like experience, and you can install it on your home screen without struggling with compatibility issues

## Getting Started ##

Step-by-step installation instructions for our self-hosted [community edition](https://photoprism.app/get) can be found 
on [docs.photoprism.org](https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/) -
all you need is a Web browser and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to run the server. 
It is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

The [latest release](https://docs.photoprism.org/release-notes/) not only includes 
**facial recognition**, it also comes as a 
**single [multi-arch image](https://hub.docker.com/r/photoprism/photoprism) for AMD64, ARM64, and ARMv7**. 
That means you don't need to pull from different Docker repositories anymore.
We recommend updating your existing `docker-compose.yml` config based on 
[our examples](https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/).
